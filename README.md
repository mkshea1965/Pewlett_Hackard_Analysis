# Pewlett_Hackard_Analysis
## Overview of the analysis:

The purpose of the new analysis is well defined. (3 pt)

The purpose of this analysis is to use SQL to analyze employee data to prepare Bobby's manager for the "silver tsunami," since many employees in Pewlett-Hackard are beginning to reach retirement age. For this assignment, six csv files containing employee data were loaded into tables created in PostgreSQL. These tables were parsed and joined using various methods in order to help prepare the company for an efflux of human capital.

## Results:

Insights:
 - 90,398 employees may retire whose roles need to be filled.
 - 29,415 of those are senior engineers. Recruiters should aim for developing younger talent or looking in the workforce for those with experience in engineering.
- There are not enough mentors to mentor the younger workers.
- Pewlett-Hackard needs to take action to mitigate future production lossses based on a decrease of human capital.

## Summary:
In all, Pewlett-Hackard is unprepared for the "silver tsunami." Incentives should be created to buy time for senior staff to stay and train younger staff. Additionally, Pewlett-Hackard should look to hire outside talent to compensate, and/or automate rank-and-file tasks.
